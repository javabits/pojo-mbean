pojo-mbean-impl
===============

pojo-mbean provides an easy way of MBean enabling your code, allowing it to be monitored and controlled using Java Management Extension (JMX) clients such as JConsole, VisualVM and Java EE web clients.

This is the impl part of the framework which takes care of the management (registration / unregistration) of the mbeans.
