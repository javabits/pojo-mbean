pojo-mbean-annotation
=====================

pojo-mbean provides an easy way of MBean enabling your code, allowing it to be monitored and controlled using Java Management Extension (JMX) clients such as JConsole, VisualVM and Java EE web clients

This bundle is the annotation part of the framework : it allows user to only take care of using the annotations by delegating the management of the mbeans to the container.
