This is the home page of the pojo-mbean project.

The pojo-mbean project was created to provide an easy-to-use method of exposing plain old Java beans (POJO's) as MBean's.

The JMX 2.0 API specification should provide something similar at some point in the future (Java SE 7), but pojo-mbean project supports very lightweight MBean specification and deployment in Java SE 5 onwards.
