= This is the home page of the pojo-mbean project =

The pojo-mbean project was created to provide an easy-to-use method of exposing plain old Java beans (POJO's) as MBean's.

The JMX 2.0 API specification should provide something similar at some point in the future (currently scheduled for Java SE 7), but pojo-mbean project supports very lightweight MBean specification and deployment in Java SE 5 onwards.

To learn about the JMX 2.0 API ([http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=255 JSR 255]) look at [http://weblogs.java.net/blog/emcmanus/archive/2007/08/defining_mbeans.html Eamonn McManus' post] on java.net.

More details will follow, including:

  * Java Source code examples (MBeans and instantiating them)
  * Screen-shots of JConsole and JMX exposed MBeans
  * Tips and tricks
