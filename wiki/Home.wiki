== Overview ==

The pojo-mbean project was created to provide an easy-to-use method of exposing plain old Java beans (POJO's) as MBean's.

pojo-mbean project provides a very lightweight MBean specification and deployment on Java SE 5 platform (onwards).
pojo-mbean has *no dependencies* on any external libraries.

== Design ==

The design og pojo-mbean is quite simple.

A number of annotations allow a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes to be marked as an [http://code.google.com/p/pojo-mbean/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/softee/management/annotation/MBean.java MBean] and its [http://code.google.com/p/pojo-mbean/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/softee/management/annotation/ManagedAttribute.java attributes], [http://code.google.com/p/pojo-mbean/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/softee/management/annotation/ManagedOperation.java operations] and [http://code.google.com/p/pojo-mbean/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/softee/management/annotation/Parameter.java parameters] to be marked and [http://code.google.com/p/pojo-mbean/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/softee/management/annotation/Description.java described].

A (moderately complex) [http://code.google.com/p/pojo-mbean/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/softee/management/helper/IntrospectedDynamicMBean.java IntrospectedDynamicMBean] class then introspects the annotated POJO bean, and exposes it as a [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/DynamicMBean.html DynamicMBean], allowing it to be registered with an MBean server. Similar to how the [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/StandardMBean.html javax.management.StandardMBean] exposes a traditional MBean/MXBean implementation/interface pair as a [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/DynamicMBean.html DynamicMBean]

Additionally, a number of helper classes and sample MBean implementations are included for documentation and easy extension.

== JMX 2.0 and JSR-255 ==

The JMX 2.0 API specification should provide something similar to pojo-mbean at some point in the future.

But while the JMX 2.0 was originally scheduled for Java SE 6, it clearly didn't make that milestone. Java SE 7 seems like the same story again, and with little or no activity for years, I wouldn't even hold my breath for Java SE 8. The most recent update on the [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=255#updates JSR-255  updates section] is _2006.01.20: This JSR is now scheduled for Dolphin (Java SE 7) and not Mustang_ and the JSR 255 status is "inactive".

To learn about the JMX 2.0 API ([http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=255 JSR 255]) look at the JMX Spec Lead [http://weblogs.java.net/blog/emcmanus/archive/2007/08/defining_mbeans.html Eamonn McManus' post on java.net].
