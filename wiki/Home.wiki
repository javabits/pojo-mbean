= This is the home page of the pojo-mbean project =

The pojo-mbean project was created to provide an easy-to-use method of exposing plain old Java beans (POJO's) as MBean's.

pojo-mbean project provides a very lightweight MBean specification and deployment on Java SE 5 platform (onwards).
pojo-mbean has *no dependencies* on any external libraries.

= Details =

More details will follow, including:

  * Java Source code examples (MBeans and instantiating them)
  * Screen-shots of JConsole and JMX exposed MBeans
  * Tips and tricks

= JMX 2.0 and JSR-255 =

The JMX 2.0 API specification should provide something similar to pojo-mbean at some point in the future.

And while the JMX 2.0 was originally scheduled for Java SE 6, it clearly didn't make that milestone. Java SE 7 seems like the same story again, and with little or no activity for years, I wouldn't even hold my breath for Java SE 8. The most recent update on the [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=255#updates JSR-255  updates section] is _2006.01.20: This JSR is now scheduled for Dolphin (Java SE 7) and not Mustang_

To learn about the JMX 2.0 API ([http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=255 JSR 255]) look at [http://weblogs.java.net/blog/emcmanus/archive/2007/08/defining_mbeans.html Eamonn McManus' post] on java.net.
